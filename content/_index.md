👋 Hi there! I'm **Rafli Hadiana**, a **Cloud Engineer** at **Quantum Teknologi** and a passionate **FOSS Enthusiast**.

I build cloud-native infrastructure, explore emerging technologies like 5G and AI, and contribute to open-source communities. When I'm not working, you'll find me trail running through mountains, traveling to new places, or writing about life and ideas.

This is my creative space to express thoughts on tech, life, and everything in between. *#livin'aquitelife*
