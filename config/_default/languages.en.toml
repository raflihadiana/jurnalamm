  bio = "A <strong>software engineer</strong> who likes to explore things. I'm focusing on <strong>server-side</strong> and <strong>cloud infrastructure</strong> because currently, I'm working as a <strong>Software Infrastructure Engineer</strong> at <strong>Gopay</strong>. While I like working on the <strong>server-side</strong>, I do quite a bit of <strong>client-side</strong> projects. I love to express my thoughts on this site. Not limited to <strong>software engineering</strong>, I like to explore other things like history, geography, mythological and philosophical stuff."
